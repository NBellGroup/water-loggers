Water table depth (WTD) and water temperature was measured using Rugged TROLL 100 Water Level Loggers (In-Situ Inc.), which were installed inside metre long dipwell tubes at undrained, drain-blocked and drained regions of each site. Loggers were installed at Forsinard Flows were installed on 29th June 2021, at Langwell on the 3rd August 2022, at Migneint on the 6th September 2022, and at Moor House on the 17th July 2022. Logger data was downloaded from Forsinard Flows on the 16th November 2022, from Migneint on the 23rd February 2023 and from Moor House on the 24th February 2023. Due to illness it has not been possible to retrieve data from the Langwell water logger at the time of writing. Retrieval of the Langwell data is planned for August 2023.

A diagram showing the placement of the logger inside the dipwell tube, and the necessary calculations based on known measurements of dipwell proportions and wire lengths required to determine WTD, is given in logger_diagram.png. Atmospheric compensation was made using a BaroTROLL Data Logger (In-Situ Inc.) which was installed at the surface of each site. Atmsopheric compensation was achieved by deducting the water logger pressure from the BaroTROLL pressure. The BaroTROLL Data Loggers also took measurements of the surface air temperature.
